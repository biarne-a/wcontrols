#summary Properties and Usage of the Circular Gauge control
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

== Overview ==

The circular gauge control consists of 2 main parts in addition to the basic control background and gloss: the *axis* and the *needle*. The needle points to the gauge's Value, and transitions between values are animated by default. Almost all of the style and functionality attributes can be customized through the Visual Studio designer or programmatically.

== Properties ==

 [CircularAxis Axis] - the CircularAxis associated with the gauge for drawing ticks and labels

 [Needle] - the Needle associated with the gauge to draw the hub, needle, and their shadows

 Value - the value on the axis that the needle should point to. Setting a new value will (if animation is enabled) start the animation to move the needle from the old value to the new value. Setting a value outside of `[`Axis.MinValue, Axis.MaxValue`]` will throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.
